# Import the Degree Programs I saved from the ATA Outcomes file into Django

"""

In this long comment I'm going to go ahead and put down a few notes on the .csv
we're reading from.

The first thing to understand is that this CSV was exported from an excel 
spreadsheet that was meant to be looked at, not fed into a computer program.
That means it's very unclean mixed data, with some rows being purely visual and
others being actual content. 

Each degree program is named in a row, and then its classes follow. The classes
are split into categories which we largely don't care about except electives,
because unlike the other classes electives are not all required to be taken. In
an ideal file format whether a class is an elective would be a checkbox in a 
separate column. But this is not an ideal format so instead it comes in this 
sectioning. That means we either have to manually fix it (eh), or do ugly hack
stuff to make it work (also eh, but my first approach).

Every individual class has a department, label, credits, and then boolean core
learning outcomes. It's necessary to be careful with the credits because the 
person who put together the spreadsheet 'chained together' classes which can be
taken in place of each other. Which by the way, some classes can be taken in 
place of each other so you have to account for that in the data structure too.
